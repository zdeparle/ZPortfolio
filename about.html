            <p>With a diverse and rich background in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering, expecting to graduate in May 2024. My journey in the realm of science and technology has been marked by significant academic achievements and rigorous involvement in innovative projects. I've had the privilege to intern at Tesla Motors and General Motors, where I significantly contributed to manufacturing mechanical engineering projects, leading to enhanced efficiency and substantial cost savings. My stint at Oak Ridge National Laboratory allowed me to delve deep into research, developing machine learning models for chemical data extraction. I've also contributed to the National Institutes of Health, focusing on improving mobility for children with cerebral palsy through designing and implementing specialized equipment. My technical prowess is marked by proficiency in CAD tools, 3D printing, programming languages such as Python and Java, and an array of engineering and analytical skills. My dedication to innovation and problem-solving continues to drive my passion for learning and contributing to the fields of engineering and technology.</p>
